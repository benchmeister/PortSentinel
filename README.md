# PortSentinel
My attempt at an adaptive recon tool that provides different assessments based on discovered open ports. Integrates tools like Nmap, Nikto, and Dirbuster for targeted scanning. Ideal for pen testing and network mapping, PortScanFlow automates decision-making to streamline vulnerability assessments and enhance reconnaissance efficiency.
