# PortSentinel
My attempt at an adaptive recon tool that provides different assessments based on discovered open ports. Integrates tools like Nmap, Nikto, and Dirbuster for targeted scanning. Ideal for pen testing and network mapping, PortScanFlow automates decision-making to streamline vulnerability assessments and enhance reconnaissance efficiency.

## Features
- **Automated Port Detection**: Scans for open ports and dynamically selects the appropriate testing tools.
- **Tool Suggestions**: Recommends tools based on specific ports (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH).
- **Modular Design**: Easily add or modify port-specific actions.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates summaries of findings for easy review and documentation.

## Work is still in progress!
